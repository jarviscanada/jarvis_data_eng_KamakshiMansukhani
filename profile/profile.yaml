summary: I am a seasoned IT professional with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and over six years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I have successfully completed more than 20 software development projects and served as a Systems Engineer at Infosys, where I honed my ability to collaborate with dedicated project managers, problem solvers, and junior staff to meet and exceed project requirements.

I pride myself on being a problem solver with a keen focus on achieving excellence through effective teamwork and communication. My technical expertise spans across database management, and I consistently challenge myself to stay abreast of emerging technologies. In addition to my technical skills, I have earned postgraduate certificates in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics, further enhancing my analytical and business acumen. My experience as a Business Systems Analyst at various esteemed organizations has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of both technical and business domains.

    description: The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent (LCMA) is designed to monitor and log resource usage across a cluster of Linux nodes. This system collects hardware and usage data, such as CPU, memory, and disk statistics, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. The primary users of this system are system administrators and the Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team, who can leverage this data to analyze system performance and make informed decisions about resource allocation. The technologies used in this project include Bash scripting, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Git.
